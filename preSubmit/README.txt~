	* any more I'm missing?

wb.c
	- FIND prompts user to search for a specified entry in the WB
	- UPDATE pompts user to pick a WB entry to update
	- CLEAR cleans the entry specified 

client.c
	- includes: 
		- encryptdecrypt.c file .	.	explained below
		- getLine function 	.	.	.	
	- 

encryptdecrypt.c
	- encode, encrypt, decrypt and decode are split into their individual functions
	- these functions return (char *)s, making it easy to send the results around the program
	- the "main funtion" for this file is the do_func function
		- this is where all the sending and receiving of strings is done
	- in the main function, a string value is assigned to "str_to_send" (a global variable)
	- str_to_send is accessed through the client by calling the get_output() function
	- this is how client.c gets results from encryptdecrypt.c
	- additional functions:
		- prepend 	.	.	.	.	puts s in front of t and saves to s
		- arrayLines 	.	.	.	reads file, puts the lines into an array

key.txt
	- contains the base64 value of our key: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
		- base64 value of our key: YWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWE=
	- other keys are included for testing purposes
