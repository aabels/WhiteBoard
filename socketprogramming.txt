TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) &IP (Internet Protocol):
Is the basic communication language or protocol of the internet. It can be used as a 
communications protocol in a private network (either intranet or extranet)

Inrtanet:
private network that is contained within an enterprise

Extrnet:
private netork that used Internet technology and the public telecommunication system to 
securely share part of a bussiness's information or operations.

Is a 2 layer program..
	HigherLayer - Transmission Control Protocol manages the assembling of a message
	 or file into smaller packets that are rtansmitted over the internet and recieved by
	a TCP layer that resembles the packets into the origin message.

	LowerLayer - Internet Protocol handles the ADDRESS part of each packet so that it 
	gets to the right destination. Each gatewat computer on the neetwork checks this
	address to see where to forward the message.

TCP/IP uses the client/server model of communication which a computer user(a client)
	requests and is provided a service (such as sending a Web page) by another 
	computer (a server) in the network. TCP/IP are considered "stateless" as in they
	do not need constant connection like a telephone call. Being stateless frees the 
	network path so everyone can use them continuously.

User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is used instead of TCP for special purposes.
Both UDP/IP run on top of the Internet Protocol. UDP just sends the packets which mean it 
has a lower bandwidth overhead latency

UDP privides 2 services not provided by the IP layer:
	1.  has port numbers to help distinguish different user requests
	2. has a checksum capability to verify that the data arrived intact.
