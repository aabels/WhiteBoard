Objective:
specification of the protocol between client and server and minimum of client-side and sever-side behavior/interaction.

Initial Handshake:
+ Connect a client to the server
+ Upon server initialization, clean all entries
+ Server Responds by sending 	'CMPUIT379 Whiteboard Server 	v0\n01\n'
+ Followed by the number of entries in the whiteboard.
+ Has max number of entries.

Whiteboard Messages:
- A client can send a query:
	1. '?12\n'
Meaning client wants 12th entry from the whiteboard.
Output(from server): '!12p#chars\nthisisthemessage\n'
if entry is empty return: '!12po\n\n'

-client can update an entry:
Input: '@12p16\nthisisthetest\n'

Output(server):'!12e0\n\n'
to indicate success of the update

-client can "clean" an entry
Input(client): '@12p0\n\n'

Error Handling:
1. If client query/update an entry with number larger than the number of entries.
Output(server): '!12e14\nNo such entry!\n'

Encryption:
openssl and Base64 functionalities
AES-256-CBC

-using EVP_aes_256_cbc()
-Base64 transformation library routines
-Base64 strings should not be split by newline characters
(option BIO_FLAGS_BASE64_NO_NL).
